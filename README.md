###Course Overview

This is an introductory course about user-centred design of interactive products and systems.

The course will provide an introduction to the HCI design process, including how to understand users through contextual interviews, how to analyse interviews to identify problems and opportunities, how to define usability goals and user experience goals, how to model users with techniques such as stages of use model and personas, how to explore solutions through scenarios, how to prototype explorations and how to evaluate prototypes for usability.
